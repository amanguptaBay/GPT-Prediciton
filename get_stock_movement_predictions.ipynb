    "- **Innovation and Product Launches**: Continuous innovation and the release of new products can drive consumer interest and sales.\n",
    "- **Brand Loyalty**: Strong brand recognition and a loyal customer base can sustain revenue and profit margins.\n",
    "- **Services Growth**: Expansion of Apple's services sector, including streaming, financial services, and cloud storage, diversifies revenue streams.\n",
